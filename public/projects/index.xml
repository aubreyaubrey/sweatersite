      <description>A YOOX purchase and a new favorite, this leopard print jacquard sweater is delicate and luxurious â€“ perfect for Spring and Summer as a colorful complement or on it&amp;rsquo;s own. I don&amp;rsquo;t usually wear V necklines but this one is just right.
Jacquard fabrics, where patterns are woven instead of printed, have a much different feel than printed textiles and since the yarn is dyed before production there is less water used in the process to create the patterned print.</description>

      <description>A boiled wool sweater the color of manzanita half price at Nordstrom Rack. My Universe knows me well!
This sweater is SO cozy yet oddly lightweight. The fabric, described as &amp;ldquo;jersey&amp;rdquo; by the brand, is 100% wool but moves and drapes like cotton. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful. It&amp;rsquo;s so soft, it feels like you have nothing on, which is my preference, except that I live in the foothills with thirty degree rain so even indoors it&amp;rsquo;s not really an option.</description>

      <title>Oversized One-of-a-kind Mohair Wool Sweater</title>

      <description>I found this gem at Flashbacks in Encinitas years and years ago. Pretty sure I was living at the cabin in Old Town at the time so it had to be somewhere around 2012 or 13. You know what? Everyone still loves this sweater. I don&amp;rsquo;t even wear it if I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood to be complimented.
I wish I knew who made this sweater. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly handmade and the maker has amazing taste.</description>

      <title>The Perfect Retro Fit Pullover</title>

      <description>The Crux Cropped Sweatshirt from Jungmaven has a classic shape and fit. Not oversized, unless you size up, this sweater is durable, medium thickness and doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear out with washing.
Composed of a heavyweight 9.6 oz French Terry hemp blend, this sweater has ribbed cuffs, bottom hem, and neckline. It keeps its shape, hangs loose but isn&amp;rsquo;t baggy. Slightly cropped, the bottom of the sweater hits right above the hips.</description>

      <title>Sunchild Blue Wool Cardigan</title>

      <description>The color of deep ocean swimming, this sweater is a vibrant mix of royal blue and teal with cornflower blue buttons. In a sea of earth tones, this sweater doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind choosing a saturated spot on the color wheel. Honestly, don&amp;rsquo;t we all have enough beige sweaters at this point?
This is another vintage store find handmade by an unsung hero. And like my gigantic mohair sweater, I get complimented on it every time I wear it.</description>
