      <description>A boiled wool sweater the color of manzanita half price at Nordstrom Rack. My Universe knows me well!
This sweater is SO cozy yet oddly lightweight. The fabric, described as &amp;ldquo;jersey&amp;rdquo; by the brand, is 100% wool but moves and drapes like cotton. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful. It&amp;rsquo;s so soft, it feels like you have nothing on, which is my preference, except that I live in the foothills with thirty degree rain so even indoors it&amp;rsquo;s not really an option.</description>

      <description>I found this gem at Flashbacks in Encinitas years and years ago. Pretty sure I was living at the cabin in Old Town at the time so it had to be somewhere around 2012 or 13. You know what? Everyone still loves this sweater. I don&amp;rsquo;t even wear it if I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood to be complimented.
I wish I knew who made this sweater. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly handmade and the maker has amazing taste.</description>

      <description>What we wear on our bodies has an impact on us. As humans continue to evolve, raise our awareness and heighten our senses, many of us are realizing that the products and clothing we choose to surround ourselves with has a huge impact, not only on our home planet but on our bodies and our minds.
When I wear a sweater or any piece of clothing that is made of wool, or cotton or any other natural fiber, my skin knows it and my nervous system responds with a feeling of safety and ease.</description>

      <description>Every time I watch the Great British Baking Show I want to know where the heck Noel Fielding gets his amazing clothes, especially his sweaters. And I just realized that everyone else wants to know too! There&amp;rsquo;s an entire instagram account devoted to his wardrobe. I was delighted to find some gorgeous merino in the mix. Here are some of the brands making Noel&amp;rsquo;s cool sweaters.
Wah Wah This Australian brand is truly niche – turning punk album artwork into wearable art with fine merino wool and unforgettable designs.</description>

      <description>The world today is all about choice. We have access to so many options in every aspect of life that most decisions are made by default. It just takes too much time to think about every decision. Things like career choice or where to live get some more attention but when it comes to daily decisions like what to eat or what to wear we often gravitate toward whatever we&amp;rsquo;re used to – whatever is easily available and keeps life flowing.</description>
