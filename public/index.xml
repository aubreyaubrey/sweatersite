      <description>A YOOX purchase and a new favorite, this leopard print jacquard sweater is delicate and luxurious – perfect for Spring and Summer as a colorful complement or on it&amp;rsquo;s own. I don&amp;rsquo;t usually wear V necklines but this one is just right.
Jacquard fabrics, where patterns are woven instead of printed, have a much different feel than printed textiles and since the yarn is dyed before production there is less water used in the process to create the patterned print.</description>

      <description>A boiled wool sweater the color of manzanita half price at Nordstrom Rack. My Universe knows me well!
This sweater is SO cozy yet oddly lightweight. The fabric, described as &amp;ldquo;jersey&amp;rdquo; by the brand, is 100% wool but moves and drapes like cotton. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful. It&amp;rsquo;s so soft, it feels like you have nothing on, which is my preference, except that I live in the foothills with thirty degree rain so even indoors it&amp;rsquo;s not really an option.</description>

      <description>I found this gem at Flashbacks in Encinitas years and years ago. Pretty sure I was living at the cabin in Old Town at the time so it had to be somewhere around 2012 or 13. You know what? Everyone still loves this sweater. I don&amp;rsquo;t even wear it if I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood to be complimented.
I wish I knew who made this sweater. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly handmade and the maker has amazing taste.</description>

      <title>The Perfect Retro Fit Pullover</title>

      <description>The Crux Cropped Sweatshirt from Jungmaven has a classic shape and fit. Not oversized, unless you size up, this sweater is durable, medium thickness and doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear out with washing.
Composed of a heavyweight 9.6 oz French Terry hemp blend, this sweater has ribbed cuffs, bottom hem, and neckline. It keeps its shape, hangs loose but isn&amp;rsquo;t baggy. Slightly cropped, the bottom of the sweater hits right above the hips.</description>

      <description>The color of deep ocean swimming, this sweater is a vibrant mix of royal blue and teal with cornflower blue buttons. In a sea of earth tones, this sweater doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind choosing a saturated spot on the color wheel. Honestly, don&amp;rsquo;t we all have enough beige sweaters at this point?
This is another vintage store find handmade by an unsung hero. And like my gigantic mohair sweater, I get complimented on it every time I wear it.</description>

      <description>So you found the best sweater ever and you want it to look new for as long as possible. Here are few tips from sweater makers about caring for natural fibers.
From SoloSix Gently soak the garment in cool water for 5 minutes with a mild detergent or shampoo. Squeeze the suds through, but avoid wringing, twisting or heavy agitation. Rinse a couple of times in clean, cool water &amp;amp; gently squeeze out any excess.</description>

      <title>How to Find The Best Sweaters on YOOX</title>

      <description>I discovered YOOX browsing for sweaters Noel Fielding has worn on the Great British Baking Show and wow is it a lot of fun. It&amp;rsquo;s not a new site by a long shot but it&amp;rsquo;s new to me! Part of the YOOX Net-A-Porte group since their 2015 merger, YOOX is a gathering place for past season clothes and also serves as a clearance site for items that haven&amp;rsquo;t sold at retail price.</description>

      <description>What we wear on our bodies has an impact on us. As we continue to evolve, raise our awareness and heighten our senses, many of us are realizing that the products and clothing we choose to surround ourselves with has a huge impact, not only on our home planet but on our bodies and our minds.
When I wear a sweater or any piece of clothing that is made of wool, or cotton or any other natural fiber, my skin knows it and my nervous system responds with a feeling of safety and ease.</description>

      <description>The world today is all about choice. We have access to so many options in every aspect of life that most decisions are made by default. It just takes too much time to think about every decision. Things like career choice or where to live get some more attention but when it comes to daily decisions like what to eat or what to wear we often gravitate toward whatever we&amp;rsquo;re used to – whatever is easily available and keeps life flowing.</description>
