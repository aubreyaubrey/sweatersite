      <description>A YOOX purchase and a new favorite, this leopard print jacquard sweater is delicate and luxurious â€“ perfect for Spring and Summer as a colorful complement or on it&amp;rsquo;s own. I don&amp;rsquo;t usually wear V necklines but this one is just right.
Jacquard fabrics, where patterns are woven instead of printed, have a much different feel than printed textiles and since the yarn is dyed before production there is less water used in the process to create the patterned print.</description>
