I found this gem at Flashbacks in Encinitas years and years ago. Pretty sure I was living at the cabin in Old Town at the time so it had to be somewhere around 2012 or 13. You know what? Everyone still loves this sweater. I don't even wear it if I'm not in the mood to be complimented. 

I wish I knew who made this sweater. It's clearly handmade and the maker has amazing taste. People always want to know where I found it, because they want to find one too. But as far as I know there's only one and someone with more skills than me really needs to make another or a hundred. 

The sleeves are beyond gigantic. The front is long. The back is short. There are pockets. It's very difficult to actually keep on if you need to do anything with your arms or body. But if you *don't* need to do much with your arms or body â€“ if you just need to walk somewhere and look good doing it or sit on the couch to look at a screen, this sweater is like living in a blanket. It's not all that soft but it is very warm! It's just so big, you can wrap it around you like a robe, you can engulf your child in it while you're reading a story, or you can drape it over someone's legs who has fallen asleep and would clearly be cozier with a sweater blanket over them.

Any sweater fans out there know of a similar style of sweater that is being produced? It can't just be oversized... it's actually a crop fit length in the back depending on how you wear it. So unique. So *best*.
