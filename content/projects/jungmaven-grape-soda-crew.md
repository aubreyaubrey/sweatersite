The <strong>Crux Cropped Sweatshirt</strong> from Jungmaven has a classic shape and fit. Not oversized, unless you size up, this sweater is durable, medium thickness and doesn't wear out with washing. 

Composed of a heavyweight 9.6 oz French Terry hemp blend, this sweater has ribbed cuffs, bottom hem, and neckline. It keeps its shape, hangs loose but isn't baggy. Slightly cropped, the bottom of the sweater hits right above the hips. 

If you look best in fitted clothes that aren't tight but more on the tailored side, this sweater is a perfect choice. It's roomy enough that you can wear a long sleeve shirt underneath but fitted enough that you can still pair it with a semi-fitted jacket and move freely.

One of my favorite things about Jungmaven fabrics is that without any synthetic fibers, they don't pile! I've had this sweater since November 2022 and the fabric is just as smooth as when I got it. The color may have faded slightly but not to any noticeable degree. If anything the few signs of wear around the wrist cuffs just make it feel more worn-in. I wear this sweater all the time because it's so comfortable and just the right thickness. <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i>

Jungmaven has a ton of great colors. I have the [Crux Cropped Sweatshirt](https://jungmaven.com/products/hemp-sweatshirt-crux-cropped-womens) in grape soda, which is now "galaxy blue" – probably a better name for the color since it's more blue than purple but definitely riding the line.
