A YOOX purchase and a new favorite, this leopard print jacquard sweater is delicate and luxurious – perfect for Spring and Summer as a colorful complement or on it's own. I don't usually wear V necklines but this one is just right. 

Jacquard fabrics, where patterns are woven instead of printed, have a much different feel than printed textiles and since the yarn is dyed before production there is less water used in the process to create the patterned print. 

This sweater is not only made of 100% cotton but that cotton was sourced according to Fair Trade principles, which emphasize protecting the environment and the people who produce garments.

The Obey brand doesn't use Fair Trade cotton exclusively. Like many clothing brands they are taking steps toward sustainability. Items that are composed of Fair Trade cotton are marked with a special tag and for every OBEY Fair Trade Certified™ product sold, a percentage is paid directly to a special fund for the workers that created the item. 

> Fair Trade is a market-based approach that empowers factory workers and farmers to fight poverty, produce quality products, protect the environment, and build strong, thriving communities for generations to come.

This sweater is a fairly thin knit and will definitely be going in the handwash pile. With a delicate weave like this, it's important to be mindful of too much agitation while washing.

I think it's common for people to think that opting for natural fibers means earth tones and no stretch. But that's a total misconception. Natural fibers are not just for hippies and boho girls.

Depending on how they're woven, natural fibers often have an optimal amount of stretch, ensuring they can fit snugly and not loosen over time. When synthetics are added to produce stretch the fibers wear out more quicly and garments often lose their shape. Jacquard fabric is special too – it has even more stretch than traditionally woven cotton. 

Opting for natural fibers doesn't limit your color palette either. I look terrible in earth tones. Some people look great in them but I just look drab and dull. When I first started being more conscious of the fabrics I was purchasing I went toward hemp clothes and some of the more well-known hemp brands. But all their colors were earth tones and just did not suit me. But there are other options! Vibrant colors and prints can also be earth-friendly.

And of course there is a spectrum when it comes to dyes. Some companies are choosing to use completely raw cotton, others emphasize sustainable dyes, and others pay less mind, choosing to clean up the best they can rather than forego their dyeing processes. Discovering how yarns and finished pieces are dyed often requires a pretty intensive research process. For now I'm sticking to natural fibers and I'm sure I'll become even more selective as time goes on and I become more educated on the topic. Progress, not perfection, right? 

I just love the pattern and the fit of this sweater. For me, color or pattern and fit are the real distinguishing qualities in clothes I keep versus clothes I wear a few times then end up donating.
