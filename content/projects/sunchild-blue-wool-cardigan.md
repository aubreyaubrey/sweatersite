The color of deep ocean swimming, this sweater is a vibrant mix of royal blue and teal with cornflower blue buttons. In a sea of earth tones, this sweater doesn't mind choosing a saturated spot on the color wheel. Honestly, don't we all have enough beige sweaters at this point?

This is another vintage store find handmade by an unsung hero. And like my [gigantic mohair sweater](/projects/project-2), I get complimented on it every time I wear it. People love this sweater, especially the color. The owner of Sunchild's Parlour in Grass Valley deserves the credit since he found it somewhere and let me buy it. I think vintage store owners are just so generous and kind to gather up all the most unique clothes and sell them to us who are short of time. It's almost cheating. 

This sweater is from a time when clothes fit people. Or it was made recently and the knitter ignored the pattern in favor of making something that would fit someone. Either way, it fits me! The sleeves are a little longer than three-quarter length with elastic in the cuffs. The collar I prefer to wear up and pin but down is nice also â€“ it's more vintage-y with the collar down. There are some cable knit sections that give it depth and texture. The fit and the color are what make this sweater so unique. I wish there were more like it!
