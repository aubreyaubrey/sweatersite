I did wonder what could possibly be so unique and amazing about this MCQ hoodie that it would normally cost $400 (I paid $76 on YOOX). But I also wondered how a McQueen hoodie would retail for $400 in the first place, when ready-to-wear sweaters from the luxury megabrand are usually closer to the $1,000 range. 

I learned that this sweater is indeed unique and amazing. I also learned that the experimental secondary line isn't really making clothes anymore. Sad face.

The most recent iteration of MCQ was launched in 2020 as a creative collective to feature collaborations and nurture new artists. Check out some of the beautiful creations and design ethos in <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/alexander-mcqueen-launches-mcq/" target="_blank">this article</a> on highsnobsociety.com. 

The operation was suspended though, in 2022, in order to center focus and energy around the main brand, Alexander McQueen. It seems like the independent brand was achieving what it set out to do, but likely wasn't as profitable as expected. The websites and tracking systems that were incorporated into the clothes are no longer functioning, but the clothes themselves, can still be had! This brand has so many cool pieces still out there for sale on sites like <a href="https://www.yoox.com/us/women/shoponline/mcq%20alexander%20mcqueen_d" target="_blank">YOOX</a>, <a href="https://www.goat.com/brand/mcq" target="_blank">goat</a> and <a href="https://www.theoutnet.com/en-us/shop/designers/mcq-alexander-mcqueen">the outnet</a>. 

> The signature tailoring and darkly romantic aesthetic of Alexander McQueen are captured in the elevated urban vibe of this line.

Super heavy weight fabric, a tapered cut at the waist, extra wide body, over-sized sleeves that are just the right length and a fully lined hood. I could do without the NFT sewn in or the blockchain tag but those aspects WERE cool when the design and production of every garment in the line could be traced. 

Aiming toward more sustainable production, the McQ line did embrace natural fibers, though not exclusively. This sweater is 100% cotton â€“ with a caveat. "Exclusive of trimmings" is a mention you won't always find shopping online. The cuffs and the band around the waist are made of 98% cotton and 2%  elastane. This sweater is so cool I'm overlooking 2% of the trimmings. 

I love this sweater and I wear it all the time. It's big and heavy but still "fits" and doesn't look like I just borrowed an XL from someone and gave up on the day (no judgement, this is a valid approach to some days). 

When the days decide to be very cold, I can wear an entire wool sweater under this sweater and it doesn't look weird. When the day decides to just be moderately cold, I can wear it with nothing else. Braless option is always extra points in my book.

> Do you know who appreciates bold patterns on clothes? Everyone. 

People just don't wear them that much, and I really don't know why. Maybe not every day cause some days you just want to blend in and get groceries but most days, I think bold patterns and colors really improve my experience of life. I also can't wear small or intricate patterns cause I look totally dumb in them, so bold patterns are it. The trick to bold patterns is finding good ones. Just cause it's bold, doesn't make it good. 

This swirly hoodie fits right into my color range too. Everyone has one. I have finally honed in on mine and it makes shopping and continuing to like my clothes, MUCH easier.

Color, pattern, fit, and quality, ALL CHECK. Love this hoodie. Buy one if they're still on sale or shop for another MCQ hoodie and treat yourself!
