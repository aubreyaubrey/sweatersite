Every time I watch the Great British Baking Show I want to know where the heck Noel Fielding gets his amazing clothes, especially his sweaters. And I *just* realized that everyone else wants to know too! There's an entire [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/noel.fieldings.wardrobe/) devoted to his wardrobe. I was delighted to find some gorgeous merino in the mix. Here are some of the brands making Noel's cool sweaters. 

### Wah Wah

This Australian brand is truly niche – turning punk album artwork into wearable art with fine merino wool and unforgettable designs. I want the eye one.

### Alexander McQueen

Inspiring style and patterns? Yes. Emphasis on natural materials? Not really, but you can find a few sweaters that are 100% or natural fiber blends.

### Palm Angels

So beautiful, so expensive, a lot of synthetic blends but a few fully natural fiber sweaters. I know it's completely common but to weave virgin wool with polyamide – I just –  it's like topping a cake with crayon shavings.

### MSGM

Tons of beautiful sweaters in wool and cashmere. Not all, but many! Even a wool bomber jacket, so gorgeous. Go crazy.

### Isabel Benenato

Virgin wool, mohair and silk blends, edgy designs, sophisticated colors, and many options for natural materials. Honestly, I like the men's line better, especially this [wool seamless crew neck](https://www.isabelbenenato.com/shop/product/843) – that color!
