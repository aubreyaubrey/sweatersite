So you found the best sweater ever and you want it to look new for as long as possible. Here are few tips from sweater makers about caring for natural fibers.

## From SoloSix 

> Gently soak the garment in cool water for 5 minutes with a mild detergent or shampoo. Squeeze the suds through, but avoid wringing, twisting or heavy agitation. Rinse a couple of times in clean, cool water & gently squeeze out any excess. Be careful not to cause stretching or distortion. Lay the garment flat between 2 towels & roll up for a minute to allow the towels to absorb the water. Place the garment on a dry towel in its original shape. Make sure it’s not in any direct sunlight or heat. Turn it over when the top side is dry.

## From Dale of Norway

> Antibacterial, dirt-repellent and self-cleaning properties give wool unique advantages when it comes to garments and textiles, and you can easily refresh your woolen clothes by hanging them out in the fresh air, instead of washing them. This saves both energy and detergents, while also extending the life of your garment.

## From Pura Cashmere

> The first thing to avoid is hangers, which can stretch out shoulders and result in misshapen sweaters. Plastic bins are equally bad for long-term storage as they retain moisture and cannot breathe. Instead, fold your sweaters and keep them in arable storage bags, which allow your cashmere to breathe. Zip closures are essential, too, as they help keep bugs out.

## From Paul Frederick

> Be sure to follow these steps when machine-washing your cotton sweaters or shirts at home:
> * Turn your sweater inside out to reduce pilling and damage to the outside
> * Place your garment in a large, mesh bag and load into the wash
> * Add a mild detergent such as Woolite™ and wash according to the care instructions on your clothing label
> * Roll the garment in a clean towel to extract water – please NEVER wring or twist, as it will warp the shape
> * Lay flat to dry or tumble dry low in a machine dryer, removing when it is almost dry to lay it flat
