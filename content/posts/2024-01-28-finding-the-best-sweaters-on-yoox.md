I discovered YOOX browsing for <a href="/blog/2024/01/where-does-host-of-the-great-british-baking-show-noel-fielding-get-his-amazing-sweaters/">sweaters Noel Fielding has worn on the Great British Baking Show</a> and wow is it a lot of fun. It's not a new site by a long shot but it's new to me! Part of the YOOX Net-A-Porte group since their 2015 merger, YOOX is a gathering place for past season clothes and also serves as a clearance site for items that haven't sold at retail price. YOOX has direct relationships with renowned fashion houses as well as manufacturers and authorized dealers for designer brands. 

> Besides being able to find top of the line clothes at up to 80% off the original price, YOOX has a huge variety of brands to choose from and filters to keep searching efficient. 

## My first YOOX box
I received my first shipment from YOOX a few days ago. I was so happy with the three sweaters I'd bought. I paid insanely low prices for superior design and crafsmanship. The beauty of the YOOX business model!

I got an Alexander McQueen hoodie, a Druhmohr cotton knit sweater and an Obey cardigan. Everything had original tags attached along with YOOX tags for return purposes. The packaging was just simple tissue paper in a brown box but on YOOX you're paying for luxury items, not luxury packaging. 

## So, how did I find the best sweaters on YOOX? 

By using the filters!! Other sites don't get as granular but on YOOX you can refine your search by category, brand, size, color, price range, and all the standard filters. But you also search by neckline, sleeve style, trend, occasion, print AND MATERIAL. There's even a sustainability filter and a smart sale guide.  There are so many beautiful sweaters out there, I'd rather just not look at all the ones made of acrylic. It's too disappointing. I've bought and lived with enough synthetic sweaters to know they are just not worth it – no matter how pretty they look in a picture.  The feeling of wearing natural materials is just too different.

## Filter that sh**

On YOOX I don't have to click on every sweater I like to see what it's made of. I just check cotton, wool, silk, cashmere, and linen and presto, no acrylic disappointment. You can also save searches and get an email when new items arrive that fit your criteria.

> Right now there are more than 10,000 sweaters made of natural materials under $200 on YOOX. More than 5,000 under $100. 

## How many sweaters?!

I know, but once you dial in your preferred colors, sleeve style and neckline, you're at a manageable number of items to look through. Then searching is fun instead of laborious. 

Of all the secondary market sites I've recently discovered, YOOX is my favorite because of the variety of high end designers, the steep discounts and the filters. When you can hone in on what colors and patterns suit you, what materials you like to wear and the size that fits most often, you really can find what you want online and save a ton of time.
